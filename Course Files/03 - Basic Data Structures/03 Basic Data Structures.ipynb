    "(Static) arrays are clearly the most often used data structure in programming contests. Whenever there is a collection of sequential data to bse stored and later accessed using their *indices*, the static array is the most natural data structure to use. As the maximum input size is usually defined in the problem statement, the array size can be declared to be this maximum input size, with a small extra buffer (sentinel) for safety - to avoid the unncessary 'off by one' `RTE`. Typically, 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays are used in programming contests - problems rarely require arrays of higher dimension. \n",

    "Typical array operations include:\n",
    "- Accessing elements by their indices\n",

    "Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary. Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as \u201cassociative memories\u201d or \u201cassociative arrays\u201d. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can\u2019t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like `append()`."
