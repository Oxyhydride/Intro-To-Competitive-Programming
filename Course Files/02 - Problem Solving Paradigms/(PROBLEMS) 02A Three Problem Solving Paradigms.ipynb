    "## Problem 9: Coin Collector\n",
    "***(Medium-Hard)***\n",

    "(Adapted from UVa 11264)\n",

    "Our dear Sultan is visiting a country where there are $n$ different types of coins. He wants to collect as many different types of coins as you can. Now if he wants to withdraw $X$ amount of money from the Bank, the Bank will give him this money using the following algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "withdraw(X){\n",
    "    if (X == 0) return;\n",
    "    Let Y be the highest valued coin that does not exceed X.\n",
    "    Give the customer Y valued coin.\n",
    "    withdraw(X-Y);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Sultan can withdraw any amount of money from the Bank. He should maximize the number of different coins that he can collect in a single withdrawal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "The first line of the input contains $T$, the number of test cases. Each of the test cases starts with $n$, the number of different types of coins. The next line contains $n$ integers, $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_n$, which represents the value of each coin type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- $1 \\leq T \\leq 7$\n",
    "- $1 \\leq n \\leq 1000$\n",
    "- $C_1$ equals to 1\n",
    "- $C_1 < C_2 < C_3 < \\cdots < C_n < 10^9$\n",
    "- Our dear Sultan can withdraw an infinite amount of money from the Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "The time limit for this problem is 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "For each test case output one line denoting the maximum number of different coins that our dear Sultan can collect in a single withdrawal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "```\n",
    "2\n",
    "6\n",
    "1 2 4 8 16 32\n",
    "6\n",
    "1 3 6 8 15 20\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Sample Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "6\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "For the first test case, it is possible for our dear Sultan to get all 6 different types of coin if he attempts to withdraw $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63$ from the Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second test case, it is possible for our dear Sultan to get a maximum of 4 different types of coins if he withdraws $1 + 3 + 8 + 20 = 32$ from the bank."
