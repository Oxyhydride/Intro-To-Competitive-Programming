For your friend, your moves would leave the options of $1$ to $3$ elements from $[2, 3, 4]$ giving them 9 points and leaving brick $5$ for you (leaving you with a score of 6), $[3, 4, 5]$ for 12 points or $[4, 5]$ for 9 points.

She has a folding bicycle which she carries with her when she uses the bus for the first part of her trip. When the bus reaches some pleasant part of the city, Jill gets off and rides her bicycle. She follows the bus route until she arrives at her destination or comes to a part of the city she does not like. She will board the bus to finish her trip in the latter event.\n",

    "Through years of experience, Jill has rated each road on an integer scale of \"niceness\". Positive niceness values indicate roads Jill likes; negative values are used for roads she does not like. There are no zero values. Jill plans where to leave the bus and start bicycling and where to stop bicycling and re-join the bus so that the **sum of niceness values of the roads she bicycles on is maximised**. This means that she will sometimes cycle along a road she does not like, provided that it joins up two other parts of her journey involving roads she likes enough to compensate. It may be that no part of the route is suitable for cycling, so Jill takes the bus for its entire route. Conversely, it may be that the whole route is so nice that Jill will not use the bus at all.\n",
